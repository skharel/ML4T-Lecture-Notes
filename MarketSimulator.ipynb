    "### Step 1 - pricesDF: 16 mins\n",
    "- read symbols in order history file, what the earliest data & last date is\n",
    "- Based on this read the data for related ticker and the date range; this method `getData` is already provided; say we call this data set prices\n",
    "- add one more column to the end of this prices data called cash and set it to 1\n",
    "  - this cash column of 1 will makes sense in step 4 but for now hang on to why\n",
    "- Here is where we are so far at: <br/> <img alt=\"MK_Sim_1.png\" src=\"images/MK_Sim_1.png\" width=\"300\"> <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2 - tradesDF: 23:40 mins\n",
    "- create trades data frame by copying our prices DF\n",
    "- this is to represent any time number of assets changes; any changes should be logged to this DF. EG buying 100 shares of apple, in appl column we should see +100; selling 100 should be -100; if nothing done, then 0\n",
    "- How to build this? 25:59\n",
    "  - 1st step: fill everything with 0 after you copy, except for dates\n",
    "  - 2nd step: populate each row step by step; come back to order file and step through each row and fill in this trades. \n",
    "    - For each row where I buy or sell, update CASH column. (28 mins more description on updating cash)\n",
    "    - eg CASH to buy = #shares * price of share = sth; then multiply by -1 to indicate we are spending money; add an entry of + #shares_to_symbol\n",
    "    - eg CASH to sell = #shares * price of share  sth; then keep this +ve because we are getting money; add an entry of - #share_to_symbol\n",
    "    - when no trades are going on, everything is 0 <br/>\n",
    "  <img alt=\"MK_Sim_2.png\" src=\"images/MK_Sim_2.png\" width=\"350\"> <br/>\n",

    "### Step 3 - HoldingsDF: 36:00 mins\n",
    "- to represent on each day how much of each individual assets I was holding & how much cash I have\n",
    "- Important part of this DF is 1st row on 1st day:\n",
    "  - initialize all columns with 0 except cash cols; this means you are not holding any stocks but just all cash\n",
    "- How to create: 38:07\n",
    "  - copy from trades and set all to 0; for cash copy to the top row, say 15,000\n",
    "- Next step to fill in this table:\n",
    "  - 1st day is special: right now we only have cash column after init steps; now on first day we have +100 of AAPL for cost of $10,000, set AAPL in holdings to 100 & reduce cash of 15,000 to 5000.\n",
    "  - 2nd row: AAPL is still 100; we traded IBM by shorting it so -100 for IBM making 11,000; Cash is 5000 + 11000 = 16000\n",
    "  - 3rd row: Same as 2nd row since no trade was done and so on\n",
    "  - Last row: Sold 100 APPL making 13000; so our entry is only -100 for IBM with case of 16+13 = 29000\n",
    "  - so we started with cash of 15,000 and ended with cash of 29000! but we owe 100 IBM too <br/>\n",

    "- Copy from Holdings DF\n",
    "- instead of each column representing the number of shares that we hold, we want it to represent values in $ for the number of shares we hold\n",
    "- value = pricesDF * holdingsDF\n",
    "  - done!\n",
    "- BTW cash column works out too, because in our pricesDF we have cash column too and set its value to 1.\n",
    "- moving all the way to end row:\n",
    "  - AAPL: 0, IBM: -$9000 and cash is $29000\n",
    "  - Finally sum across columns (axis 1) which returns to us value day by day for each row; this is what we need to return <br/>\n",
