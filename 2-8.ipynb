    "\n",
    "### 2. Semi Strong\n",
    "- says that prices adjust immediately to new public information; so for instance when company reports their quarterly reports, the prices react immediately to that information.\n",
    "- this prohibits even fundamental analysis; one possibility left here is insider information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Strong:\n",
    "- prices reflect all information public and private\n",
