Usually we have to do complete re-run of the algorithm to update the model. Thus for parametric model training is slow but querying is fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For instance based model, we have to store all the data points. So, it is hard to apply when we have huge data sets but new evidence can be added easily since no parameters need to be learned. Because of this, adding data points doesn't consume additional time which leads to faster training time; however, querying is slow. Because non parameteric avoids assuming certain type of model, be it linear or quadratic or so on, which makes them suitable to fit any type of complex patter where we don't really know what the underlying model is like"
