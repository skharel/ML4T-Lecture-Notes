    "\n",
    "- Why do stock splits? One common reason is price is too high. \n",
    "- Why is high price a problem? more price to pay for a block of 100 shares; people can buy smaller block of shares but for options trading, where stocks are usually traded with regard to 100 shares; so options covering suddenly become very expensive and less liquid.\n",
    "- Even in case of buying one stock, say for kid's account that you are setting up, it can be a problem even when buying few shares. \n",
    "- If you are building a finely tuned proportion of each stock in your portfolio, if some stocks price are too high it becomes difficult to get the fine resolution that you want.\n",
    "- So when price gets too high company take 1 share, eg that costs $300 and bring the price to $75 by doing 4:1 split\n",

    "- Suppose you got this above split data and the computer is reading it to analyze for trading opportunities; well your algorithm might discover that the split was a shorting opportunity to reap significant reward. This is however wrong; so if you want to trade using this data, then you have account for all the splits which becomes a problem\n",

    "\n",
    "- `adjusted close` or `adjusted prices`: the idea is to create a timeline of prices that are adjusted to account for these changes such that you can look back over adjusted close, simulate buying at a particular time and seeing how the value increases over time accurately without having to account for the splits.\n",

    "  - first 2:1 split: we go back to all the historical data and adjust it by dividing by 2\n",
    "  - then when we get to 4:1 split, we have to first divide by 2 and then by 4\n",

    "\n",
    "- Just like split, you adjust the price by % of dividend going back in history; the rationale is that if you were to hold the stock from some time ago and hold it all the way through dividend payment, then the current price reflects the increase in your value of holding along with dividend paid; so the adjustment is achieving its purpose which is to allow us not to worry about dividends and splits. So you can basically go back in time, buy the share and see how much value it accumulates. <br/>\n",
