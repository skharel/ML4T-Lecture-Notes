    "- `Fundamental analysis` involves looking at aspects of a company in order to estimate its value; fundamental investors look for a situations where the price of a company is below its value\n",
    "- `Techincal analysis` where technicians don't care about the value of a company; instead they look for patterns or trends in the price. We will look more into technical analysis."

    "- Still there are reasons why it might work:\n",
    "  - there is information in price and price change; it reflects sentiments of buyers and sellers and especially if we see that the price for particular stock is moving in different direction then the overall market, that might be a hint that there's something going on.\n",
    "  - heuristics work: \n",
    "    - additionally we know that in other domain of artificial intelligence heuristics can work, and they work frequently\n",
