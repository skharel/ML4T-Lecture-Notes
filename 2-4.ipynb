    "- Most significant ideas affecting in finance in the last century\n",
    "- It explains how the market impacts individual stock prices\n",
    "- It also provides mathematical framework for hedge fund investing\n",
    "- Developed by number of researchers independently in 1960's; \n",
    "- William Sharpe, Harry Markowitz and Merton Miller jointly received the nobel prize for this contribution in 1990\n",
    "- CAPM led to the development of `index funds` and the belief that you can't beat the market"

    "- So what CAPM model is asserting is that a significant portion of the return for a particular stock is due to the market; in other words `market moving up or down strongly affects the change on price on every individual stock`; the extent to which the market affects a particular stock is encapsulated in the Beta; every stocks has their own individual beta\n",
    "- The other component `alpha is` called `residual`. Based on beta calculation, it won't match exactly what the stock prices should have been; that is what this alpha (or residual) is for\n",
